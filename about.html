<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am currently a PhD student in the Multiphysics Simulation and Optimization Laboratory 
    at UC Berkeley. My research interests lie in numerical optimization, simulation, and 
    multi-physics modeling. My current work aims to develop optimization schemes for 
    numerical simulations of reaction kinetics for advanced manufacturing. Previously, I 
    worked as a staff scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for 4 1/2 years 
    where I worked on simulation, optimization, hardware and chemical formulation for 3D 
    printing, and at Googleâ€™s X the Moonshot Factory where I worked as an AI resident in 
    materials optimization.</p>
