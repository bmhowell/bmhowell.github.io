<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://msol.berkeley.edu">Multi-physics Simulation and Optimization Laboratory</a> 
    at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> where I specialize in numerical optimization for materials design. I am 
    interested high performance computing for applied math/physics, but am generally application agnostic. More than anything, I enjoy chasing 
    flow states powered by light-roast espresso and C++. </p>
    
    Previously, I worked as a staff scientist at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> 
    where I worked on simulation, optimization, hardware and chemical formulation for 3d printing, and at <a href="https://x.company"> Google X </a> 
    where I worked as an AI resident in materials optimization.</p>

<p> I have a variety of interests including running very long distances, foreign film, olives, olive oil, uppers (not downers), discrepancies between 
    Talebian philosophy and Talebian tweets, Jewish atheism, 1980's Japan, 1990's New York, 2000's Silicon Valley,
    Indian food in England, Indian food in India, desert wealth, and sliding the word 'optimisation' into conversations. 

</p> Here are some logs of my musings and travels:
