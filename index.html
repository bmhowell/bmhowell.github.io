<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://msol.berkeley.edu">Multi-physics Simulation and Optimization Laboratory</a> 
    at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. I am interested high performance computing, applied math/physics, and finance.</p>

    <p> More than anything, I enjoy chasing flow states: espresso + C++, espresso + scheming/plotting, espresso + running, espresso + reading. </p>
    
    Previously, I worked as a staff scientist at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> 
    for 4.5 years where I worked on simulation, optimization, hardware and chemical formulation for 3d printing, and at <a href="https://x.company"> Googleâ€™s X the 
    Moonshot Factory</a> where I worked as an AI resident in materials optimization.</p>

    Here are some logs of my musings and travels:
