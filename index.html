<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://msol.berkeley.edu">Multi-physics Simulation and Optimization Laboratory</a> 
    at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> where I specialize in numerical optimization for materials design. My experise 
    lie in optimization,
    simulation, and high performance computing. More than anything, I enjoy chasing flow states powered by light-roast espresso and C++ 
    in pressure cooker environments. </p>

    Previously, I was an AI resident in materials optimization at <a href="https://x.company"> Google X </a> , and a staff scientist at 
    <a href="https://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>  where I worked on simulation, optimization, hardware and 
    chemical formulation for 3d printing. My undergraduate degree is in chemical engineering with a focus on control theory. </p> 
    

<p> I have a variety of interests including running very long distances, foreign film, olives, olive oil, discrepancies between 
    Talebian philosophy and Talebian tweets, Thielian economics, Jewish atheists, 1980's Japan, 1980's New York, 2000's Silicon Valley,
    Indian food in England, Indian food in India, desert wealth, and sliding the word 'optimisation' into conversations. 

</p> Here are some logs of my musings and travels:
