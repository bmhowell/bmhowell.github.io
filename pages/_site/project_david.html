<h1> Project David (in development phase)</h1>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co">Bryan Johnson's Blueprint</a> and Michaelangelo's David, I am working on designing a protocol
  to eliminate poor decision making at critical times of the day. I struggle with sleep, which wreaks havoc on every aspect of my life. I also watched 
  my sister suffer from cancer and die at the age 18. This protocol is primarily an effort to address these genetic deficiencies and potential 
  risks. </p>

<h1> Sleep </h1>

<p>I have tried many approaches and substances to improve my sleep, but have found that cognitive behavioral therapy is the only effective solution. Nearly 
every substance and drug negatively effects my ability either fall asleep, stay asleep, or maintain high levels of REM and deep sleep (tracked with Oura 
ring). Thus, I have had to follow a militant schedule: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    7:00  PM - All blue light is removed from my work space, replaced with red LED lamp and red filters on all screens. 
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../images/night_setup.jpg" alt="Centered Image" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</div>
<ul>
  <li>9:30 PM
    <ul>
      <li>All cognitive work (coding and reading especially) and socializing must stop</li>
      <li>No exceptions</li>
      <li>Hot shower, brush teeth, skin care, etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>10:00 PM
    <ul>
      <li>Intake 250mg of Magnesium (improves my REM sleep) and 5mg of melatonin</li>
      <li>Airpods Pro, combined with Bose QC25 noise cancelling headphones, in a silent room. With this set up I can hear my blood flow</li>
      <li>Breathing exercises 4-7-8 technique for 30 cycles</li>
      <li>15 minutes of meditation focusing on heartbeat and bloodflow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>10:30 PM  
    <ul>
      <li>In bed with an eye mask on, in a room with blackout curtains</li>
      <li>Since the age of 8, I have listened to Jim Dale narrating Harry Potter as I fall asleep, a tradition that I still maintain</li>
      <li>Sleep occurs in about 10-15 minutes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7:30 AM - Wake up</li>
</ul>


<h1> Exercise </h1>
<ul>
  <li>7:30 AM </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Stretch: hamstrings, calves, quads (couch stretch) </li>
      <li> Simulatanously reading WSJ + Hacker News + markets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7:45 AM - Quick warm-up circuit: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> 10 pull-ups </li>
      <li> 30 weighted situps</li>
      <li> 30 pushups</li>
      <li> (Circuit is repeated every 3 more times throughout the day)</li>
    </ul>
  
  <li>
    8:00 AM 
  </li> 
    <ul>
      <li> 5-15km run or 25km cycle (trail)</li>
      <li> Running and cycling has been a part of my life since the age of 5 </li>
      <li> Road cycling has been permanantly removed from my life after a traumatic accident</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
  

<h1> Diet </h1>
<p>My diet is designed to support my endurance sport and cognitive lifestyle. This is somewhat difficult and is a little bit in flux, but in general I strive
to keep carbohydrate and sugar intake at a minimum, and fat and protein intake at a maximum. I also try and minimize meat consumption, but am by no means 
vegetarian or vegan. This diet is my default and I do not prohibit living life when the opportunity presents itself. Here is my default eating routine:</p>

<h2> Breakfast 9:00 AM </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Coffee:
    <ul>
      <li> 2 shot espresso with freshly ground medium roast beans (Monterrey Market)</li>
      <li> 60-70mg of caffeine per day with a max of 100mg (drip/Aeropress). </li>
      <li> Every quarter, I go on a two week caffeine fast. </li>
      <li> No caffeinated beverages after 11AM. </li>
      <li> Decaf coffee ok during caffeine fast, and/or up to 1PM during the day. </li>
      <li> If at a cafe with friends, I will take a cortado or cappuccino. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sunnyside up:
    <ul>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons of crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> Second Breakfast </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Smoothie:
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of oat milk (Costco)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of frozen blueberries (Costco)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of strawberries (Costco)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of almonds (Costco)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted cashews (Costco)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of chia seeds (Trader Joe's)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of flax seeds (Trader Joe's)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of cocoa powder (Whole Foods)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of cinnamon (Whole Foods)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Greek yogurt:
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of plain Greek yogurt (Trader Joe's)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> Lunch </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Very large salad:
    <ul>
      <li>Half a box of 50/50 spring salad and spinach mix (Whole Foods)</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of almonds</li>
      <li>1 slice from a block of feta cheese (Whole Foods)</li>
      <li>1 avocado (Costco)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2> Second Lunch </h2>
<p> Smoothie (same as above)</p>

<h2> Past Diet </h2>
<p> I used to have a very hardcore, 22/2 time-restricted diet the consisted of a pure fruit smoothie (berries+strawberries+oat milk) and a single large salad 
  (same as above). This was consumed within a two hour period every day between 4-6PM. I maintained this diet for about 2 years. However, I struggled to get 
  enough protein, B12, and keep fat above 5% of body weight. As a part of Project David, I must look like David and therefore need to maintain some upper body
  muscle.
