<h2>Reaction Kinetics for Advanced Materials</h2>
My doctoral work focuses on the development of dual-curing resins for advanced manufacturing. The 
first stage of curing is a UV-curing step that allows for the printing of complex structures that
would otherwise collapse under their own weight. This stage is facilitated by the activation of 
photo-initiators that chain react with acrylate monomers. Although these reactions are occur in
stages, each is inter-dependent on the other resulting in a highly-coupled multi-physics problem.

The simulations from my doctoral work focus on tracking reaction, diffusion, and heat transfer in
composite material systems which involves solving a system of partial differential equations.
